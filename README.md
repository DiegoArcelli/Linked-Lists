# Linked-Lists
The program implements four type of linked lists:
<ul>
  <li>Singly linked list</li>
  <li>Doubly linked list</li>
  <li>Circular singly linked list</li>
  <li>Circular doubly linked list</li>
</ul>
For each type of list the user can perform the following operations:
<ul>
  <li>Insert a node in the head of the list</li>
  <li>Insert a node in the tail of the list</li>
  <li>Insert a node in the middle of the list</li>
  <li>Print a textual rappresentation of the list (using a recursive function)</li>
  <li>Print a graphical rappresentation of the list (using an iterative function)</li>
  <li>Delete an element from the list</li>
</ul>
For the circular singly list I only used a pointer to the first node of the list, while for the
circular doubly list I also used a pointer to the last node of the list.
